# Wieso Ich Mathe Liebe
A (German) book's hand-written draft that aims to convince non-mathematicians of the beauty of mathematics.

It goes through some well-known and some not-so-well-known proofs with steps so small that they can hopefully be considered *absolutely logical*.
(I consider this the essence of math.)

An example screenshot from the proof of *Pythagora's theorem*:

I also shed some light on the "art of defining" mathematical notions, which should help in understanding why school and university focuses on these notions.
